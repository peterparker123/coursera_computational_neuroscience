In this quiz, you will take your first step into the process of encoding. 
The aim of this quiz is to help you come to a better understanding of how 
to calculate a spike-triggered average and its use in determining the relevant
features within a stimulus. We have provided you with an experimentally recorded
set of spikes recorded from the famous H1 motion-sensitive neuron of the fly 
(in this case, Calliphora vicina) from the lab of Dr Robert de Ruyter van Steveninck. 
This neuron responds to motion: your job is find out how exactly it processes a motion stimulus. 
You are also given the velocity of a pattern of vertical bars experienced by the fly during the 
recording of those spikes. Your job is to write a bit of Matlab/Octave/Python code to read the 
data and compute the spike-triggered average from methods you have learned throughout this week's lectures.
